       IVS Analysis Report for R1913 ($19SEP23XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 


This sessions was re-analyzed and resubmitted to IVS after the missing 
AGGO log file was received. 


Problems: No met data in SESHAN25 log. NOTO barometer is broken and gives
          erroneous readings; all met data zeroed out. SESHAN25 has some
          S-band subambiguities.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: NYALE13S and WETTZ13N did not observe.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
