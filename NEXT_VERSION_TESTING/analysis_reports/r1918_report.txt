       IVS Analysis Report for R1918 ($19OCT28XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: FORTLEZA did not participate due to a broken LO.
          Three clock breaks used at YARRA12M: 03:00, 05:17 and 10:07 UTC. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: This is the refringed version. Originally there were many 
          X-band subambiguities at YARRA12M and S-band subambiguities at
          SEJONG. Refringing gained 214 observations in the solution. 
          NYALE13S was included for testing but no data available.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
