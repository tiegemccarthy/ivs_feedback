       IVS Analysis Report for R1916 ($19OCT14XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Large clock offset and large clock break at WARK12M. Apriori 
          offset of -.017919 seconds applied and clock break at 22:00
          of ~-.1173 seconds.
          MATERA small clock break at ~19:25.
          YARRA12M small clock breaks at ~01:45 and ~03:50. 
          SEJONG-NYALES20 has a fairly large baseline clock offset (-226 psec).
          ISHIOKA did not observe due to a typhoon.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: This is the version refringed to correct S-band subambiguities
          at MATERA. Uses 111 more observations than the previous version.
