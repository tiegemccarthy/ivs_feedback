       IVS Analysis Report for CRF115 ($19DEC11XN) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Very low data yield. KOGANEI started 9 hours late. HOBART26
          missed ~5 hours due to wind stows and a full module. HARTRAO
          was scheduled only for the first 21.5 hours. Channels X1-X4
          were deleted at KOGANEI and URUMQI due to RFI. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: None.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
