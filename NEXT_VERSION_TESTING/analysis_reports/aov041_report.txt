       IVS Analysis Report for AOV041 ($19NOV12XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: HOBART26 had low yield due to wind stows, drive crashes and field
          system crashes. ISHIOKA was used as the clock reference instead.
          KOGANEI had S-band RFI.
          SESHAN25 did not observe due to antenna maintenance.
          No fringes found to VERAMZSW. 
          WARK12M  did not observe, no operational staff available.
          Large baseline clock offsets on YARRA12M baselines.
           

Parameterization comments: None.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
