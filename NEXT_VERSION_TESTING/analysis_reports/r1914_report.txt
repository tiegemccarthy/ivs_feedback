       IVS Analysis Report for R1914 ($19SEP30XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Revised analysis report. Approximately 600 observations were refringed
  to correct S-band subambiguities at MATERA and SEJONG. The solution
  now uses 390 more observations than the previous one. A revised vgosBD
  database has been submitted to cddis.


Problems: SEJONG and KOKEE were noisy. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: ISHIOKA, NYALE13S and WETTZ13N did not participate.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
