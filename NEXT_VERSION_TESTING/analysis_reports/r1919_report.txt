       IVS Analysis Report for R1919 ($19NOV04XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: FORTLEZA did not participate due to a broken LO. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: This is the version refringed to correct S-band subambiguities
          at MATERA and SEJONG. An additional 228 observations are used in the 
          solution. 
          NYALE13S recorded some test data only.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
