       USNO Analysis Report for R1884 ($19MAR04XA) 
       This report is a contributed analysis report that does not correspond to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by Nicole Geiger, Naval Observatory.
    Spoolfile source: interactive nuSolve analysis.) 


***WARNING:  Some station(s) are in spoolfile but not scheduled: WETTVDIF***
***          Please also check the master schedule file to make sure it is correct for this session.***

Problems: KOKEE missed scans 064-1108 to 064-1112 due to the VSI4 Sampler Module timing out.
	  The sampler had to be rebooted and the formatter was resynced.
	
	  SEJONG had several sub-ambiguities in S-band, primarily along the Ke-KV and Kv-Yg
	  baselines.

 	  WETTZELL had no data after scan 064-0955 possibly due to copying scans from the Mark5
	  module onto flexbuff.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: WETTZELL recorded in parallel to flexbuff in the VDIF format (WETTVDIF).
	 	The quality of the data for WETTVDIF was good, but was deselected for
		final analysis.
