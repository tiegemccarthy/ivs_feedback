       IVS Analysis Report for CRF111 ($19JUL03XN) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: NOTO met data was bad. Presures jumped around between 1028 and
           1097 mbars. The met data was removed from the log.
          Large baseline clock offsets on the NOTO baselines.
          Cable cals not used at HARTRAO or MATERA because manual phase
           cals were used and MATERA's cable cal has a break.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: ZELENCHK changes from 5 to 6 S-band channels at 08:21, 
          but no clock break needed.
          YEBES40M was out for maintenance.
