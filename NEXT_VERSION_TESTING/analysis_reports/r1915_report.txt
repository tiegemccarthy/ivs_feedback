       IVS Analysis Report for R1915 ($19OCT08XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: MATERA is very noisy. The cable cal was unstable and was not 
          applied. Small clock breaks are used at 281/19:20 and 282/14:35.
          SESHAN25 was out for ~4 hours for CE-4 schedule. SESHAN25
          has no met data.
          HART15M has only non-detections during the last 8.5 hours
          due to an unlocked LO.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: This is the refringed version. The original version had 
          several hundred S-band subambiguities on the MATERA and SESHAN25
          baselines. This solutions gets 670 more observations in the 
          solution, with 534 more to MATERA and 164 more to SESHAN25. 
          NYALE13S did not observe.
