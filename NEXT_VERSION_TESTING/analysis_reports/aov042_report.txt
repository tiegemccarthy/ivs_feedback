       IVS Analysis Report for AOV042 ($19DEC03XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: HOBART26 data is sparse due to windstows and field system crashes;
          no data last 8.5 hours.
          KOGANEI had S-band RFI and missed the last 10 hours due to 
          recorder problems.
          WARK12M has a small clock break at ~11:03 UTC.
          YARRA12M has two small clock breaks at ~23:36 and ~11:52 UTC. 
          SEJONG is very noisy and some of the baselines are bimodal in 
          X-band. Large baseline clock offsets on SEJONG baselines.
          VERAMZSW lost data due to snowfall, no data last 3 hours. 
          There is really no good station to use as the clock reference,
          but VERAMZSW is used since it has the fewest issues.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: None.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,

  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
