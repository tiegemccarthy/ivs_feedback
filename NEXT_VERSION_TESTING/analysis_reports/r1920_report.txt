       IVS Analysis Report for R1920 ($19NOV11XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 


Re-processed version. If you picked up an earlier version please replace it.


Problems: NOTO had pointing problems and their pressure data was bad.
          HART15M's LO was unlocked for ~10 hours.
          WARK12M did not observe.
          NYALE13S observed some test scans. Fringes were found in one, but the
          data are still not usable

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: This session was refringed several times to fix a tonemask
          error on the ISHIOKA X-band and S-band subambiguities at SEJONG.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
