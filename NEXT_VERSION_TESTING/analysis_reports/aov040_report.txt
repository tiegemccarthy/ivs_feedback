       IVS Analysis Report for AOV040 ($19OCT15XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

The session has been re-analyzed after receiving the URUMQI log file.

Problems: No SEJONG data, problem with hard disk and new operating system.
          WARK12M missed the first 4.5 hours trying to debug a .1 second time
          difference between the FS and the Fila10G. They also stopped for ~6
          hours due to high winds.
          HOBART26 did not participate.
          No met data in the SESHAN25 log.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
