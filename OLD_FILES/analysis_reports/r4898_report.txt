       IVS Analysis Report for R4898 ($19JUN13XE) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by Christopher Dieck, US Naval Observatory.
    Spoolfile source: interactive nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems:
    KATH12M  - First successful scan was 164-2325.
    MATERA   - There is a large jump in the cable calibration, which did have a
               negative impact on the residuals, so was turned off. Only the
               first ~2.5 hours of the experiment were successfully observed,
               which also had sub-ambiguities that prevented a solution. The
               station was deselected.
    NYALES20 - Final successful scan was 165-1744b.
    WETTZ13N - Did not participate. Out for maintenance.
    YARRA12M - The relative humidity data was non-physical and was replaced by
               the default value of 50%. Added an a priori +1.0 second clock
               offset.

Parameterization comments: None.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
