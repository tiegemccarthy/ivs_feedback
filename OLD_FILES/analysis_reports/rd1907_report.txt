       IVS Analysis Report for RD1907 ($19JUL24XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: HARTRAO showed many breaks. Clock break terms set at 00:52, 06:44,
           08:00, 08:57, 14:30, 15:50 and 16:30.
          WETTZELL had receiver problems and was out from 11:09-12:25 and
           13:25-18:00 (end of session). A clock break is needed during the
           first outage (~12:00). NYALES20 was used as the reference clock
           instead of WETTZELL.
          TIANMA65 did not participate due to antenna maintenance.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: Position of 3C48 needs to solved for, adjustment is ~58 mas.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.
